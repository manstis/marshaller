# J2CL Marshaller example
This uses the code generated by `@XMLMapper` transpiled
to JavaScript using Google's Closure Compiler running in the browser.

Change directory to `marshaller-gwt` and issue `mvn clean install`
- Double-click `target/marshaller-j2cl-xxx/index.html`

The browsers console will show both the deserialized model and serialized XML
